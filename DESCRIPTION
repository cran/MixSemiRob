Description: Various functions are provided to estimate parametric mixture models
    (with Gaussian, t, Laplace, log-concave distributions, etc.) and
    non-parametric mixture models. The package performs hypothesis tests
    and addresses label switching issues in mixture models.
    The package also allows for parameter estimation in mixture of regressions,
    proportion-varying mixture of regressions, and robust mixture of regressions.
